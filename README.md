GLUT XML Renderer

Designed to help me set up an environment to test different shaders without wading through OpenGL
over and over. Will work on describing XML syntax soon. 

To build on Windows, you'll probably have to configure some libs through the GUI. I modified those
findLibrary scripts to do it for me, so you're welcome to do the same.
